## Data and Chart Description

This assignment uses two csv files in the `dataset/` folder: `females_data.csv` and `males_data.csv`. From 1991 to 2022, these list a series of countries and their corresponding female and male employment rates respectively. In the visualization that you create (see image below), there will be a dropdown listing 5 countries; when the user changes the country in the dropdown, that country's employment rate will be shown for males and females using a lollipop chart.
